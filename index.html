<p>Today I will give you a full roadmap on how to learn all of this and become a full-stack developer, we will go over a very simple overview of the 3 parts of full-stack development including what you should learn for each one to be good enough, a step-by-step path on how to learn each part, and I will even give you one key tip to give you a massive edge in interviews that almost all beginners miss. 

    So what is fullstack development? Well simply, on the web we have the frontend and the backend. The front end is the visual part of the web that you see on your screen. the backend is what happens behind the scenes. And these two together alongside something called Devops, form the full stack of web development.
